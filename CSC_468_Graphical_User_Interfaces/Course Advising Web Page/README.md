# Welcome to Project 2

## Usability Notes for Dr. Weiss
1. Any password with 8+ characters is accepted, we're not worring about security for this proof of concept
2. Try logging in as 6543219 and you "should" see some preloaded data (simulating an existing user logging in)
3. Go back to the log in page and try logging in as a new user (you'll notice that the form is empty)

## Known Issues and Bug Report
There are a number of issues we couldn't resolve before finishing the project.

1. Using the back button sometimes makes table collapsing funky (e.g. arrows pointing the wrong way, etc.)
2. Sometimes table collapsing doesn't let you close sections.  Not really sure why
3. When loading classEntry.php, CSC elective grades are remembered, but not the corresponding classes
4. The same applies for some of the general education classes
5. Recommendations always suggests CSC 300, not really sure why
