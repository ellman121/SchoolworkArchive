## This is a collection of all my schoolwork done at SDSMT

### Contents:

#### CSC 250 - Computer Science Two
This is a second course in CS, where students cover basic structures such as pointers, linked lists, and basic ADT's

| Program Name | Description |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MP3TagEditor | This program was made to edit ID3v1 Tags on MP3 files |
| Linked List Class | This program implements a linked list as a C++ Class |
| Reverse Typoglycemia | This program uses a dictionary to do reverse typoglycemia on an input file |

#### CSC 300 - Data Structures
This is a sophomore level course desigend to introduce basic data structures and algorithms, using C++ as the primary language.  Topics include trees, graphs, Big-Oh analysis, and introductory algorithms.

| Program Name | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LinkedList Struct | This program implements and bubble sorts a linked list using C-Structs |
| RedBlack Tree | This program implements a Red-Black Tree.  All updates to the tree are done on disk. |
| Set-Union Timing | This program uses three methods to find the union of two sets, and outputs the time difference between them.  The methods are bubble-sort style search, the merge algorithm from merge-sort, and hash table insert/collision.|
