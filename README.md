### Contents:

#### CSC 250 - Computer Science Two
This is a second course in CS, where students cover basic structures such as pointers, linked lists, and basic ADT's

| Program Name | Description |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MP3TagEditor | This program was made to edit ID3v1 Tags on MP3 files |
| Linked List Class | This program implements a linked list as a C++ Class |
| Reverse Typoglycemia | This program uses a dictionary to do reverse typoglycemia on an input file |

#### CSC 300 - Data Structures
This is a sophomore level course desigend to introduce basic data structures and algorithms, using C++ as the primary language.  Topics include trees, graphs, Big-Oh analysis, and introductory algorithms.

| Program Name | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LinkedList Struct | This program implements and bubble sorts a linked list using C-Structs |
| RedBlack Tree | This program implements a Red-Black Tree.  All updates to the tree are done on disk. |
| Set-Union Timing | This program uses three methods to find the union of two sets, and outputs the time difference between them.  The methods are bubble-sort style search, the merge algorithm from merge-sort, and hash table insert/collision.|

#### CSC 314 - Assembly Language
This is a sophomore level course where students implement programs in ARM assembly, and use a Raspberry Pi for debugging/testing.  Topics range include ARM architecture, and both fixed and floating point arithmetic.

| Program Name | Description |
|------------- | ----------- |
| Lab 1 | This lab was a demo program provided to students for them to figure out how to compile and run code on a Raspberry Pi |
| Lab 2 | This lab was for students to figure out how to use standard in and out in assembly language using printf and scanf calls |
| Lab 3 | This lab was the first "assignment" in Assembly Language.  Prompt the user for numbers, print the max and min, then print the count of negative and positive numbers. |
| Lab 4 | This lab provides students with a checksum program written in c and asks them to convert them into assembly. |
| Lab 5 | This program prompts the user for an integer and then prints out all prime numbers between 1 and n.  The algorithm to find primes is not fast. |
| Lab 6 | This lab reads in 4 sets of integers, where each integer is the number of coins (pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters) saved each week, and then prints out the yearly savings | 
| Lab 7 | This lab asks the user for two x values and a number of rows, then evaluates the function f(x) = (x^2 - 3x - 2) / (x^2 - 4) at a number of points, and then outputs a table of values for the function.
| Lab 8 | This lab is an introduction to GPIO, where the user has 3 buttons and 3 LED's.  The buttons increment, reset, and decrement the counter, and the LED's output the low 3 bits of the count.  

#### CSC 317 - Computer Organization and Architecture
This course is an introduction to computer hardware.  It provides students with a historical background in computing.  Topics include Error Correcting Codes, Computer Emulation, and hardware implementation of assembly instructions.

#### CSC 413 - Cryptography
This coures is an advanced course in cryptography from a mathematical standpoint.  Topics include classical cryptosystems (Caesar, Vigenere, Playfair, ENIGMA), symmetric-key cryptosystems (DES, AES), Public-Key Cryptography (RSA, Pohlig-Hellman, ElGamal), Secure Hashing, and Security Protocalls.  The coures also briefly covers attacking cryptosystems.

#### CSC 461 - Programming Languages
This course is an introduction to the study of programming languages.  The first set of material is over programming language design.  Second, the course covers programming language paradigms.  Topics include formal languages, automata, parsing and compiling, data abstraction, variable binding, block-structured languages, OOP, functional programming, and parallelism.
