This program will take a input file named in.in. This file will contain 4 12 bit binary strings l1r1, l4r4, l1*r4*,l4*r4*.  (The meaning for these can be found in Trappe and Washington's text titled Introduction to Cryptography with Coding Theory)

The program will output several potential keys and write them to test_cast.txt.
